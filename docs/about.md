## About ChannelFetch

**ChannelFetch** is an experimental portfolio project built with **Streamlit**, **OpenAI**, and the **YouTube Data API**.

#### ‚öôÔ∏è How is it different from just using ChatGPT?

Unlike ChatGPT alone, ChannelFetch directly pulls data from YouTube via the YouTube Data API. This gives it access to real, up-to-date information about channels and their content.

#### ‚öôÔ∏è How is it better than the default YouTube search?

YouTube search tends to highlight trending videos. ChannelFetch, on the other hand, helps you understand the *source*.  
If you're looking for, say, yoga channels, it will tell you whether a video comes from a channel focused on traditional practices or modern, alternative approaches.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

Each user has a limited number of free API requests. After reaching the limit, access is temporarily blocked for 1 hour to ensure fair use.

#### üõ† GitHub & API Keys

This project is open-source, you can find the code [here](https://github.com/NeLyu). You'll need to provide your own API keys to run it locally.
