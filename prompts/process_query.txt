Task:
* Detect the topic of the YouTube search query.
* Provide complementary search phrases if the query is too vague.
* If the query is too vague, generate three complementary, more specific search phrases related to the topic.
* If the query already provides enough context and specificity, leave it as is and return the original query without additional phrases.

Instructions:
1. Analyze the input query to identify its main topic.
2. Assess whether the query is specific enough for YouTube search purposes:
    If specific, keep the query unchanged and return it with the topic.
    If too vague, generate three general but relevant search phrases to clarify the topic.
