# ðŸ“¦ YouTube Channel Navigator

That's a compact agent for finding and comparing channels relevant to your query by using both YouTube Data API and OpenAI reasoning.

### How is it different from ChatGPT alone?

It extracts data directly from YouTube Data API.

### How is it different from the default YouTube search?

It does not only find trending video but gives you info about the channel it comes from.
For example, if your are looking for channels about yoga, the agent will tell you whether the video comes from a source with a focus on traditional practices or on alternative modern approaches.

Provides the user with links to the relevant channels and gives a short summary based on their descriptions.
